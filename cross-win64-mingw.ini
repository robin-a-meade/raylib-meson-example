# Cross build definition file for compiling a 64-bit x86_64 executable for Windows
#
# Prerequisites on Fedora Linux
#
#   sudo dnf install mingw64-gcc
#   sudo dnf install wine-core     # For testing the Windows .exe file on linux
#
# Set up a build directory:
#
#   meson setup --cross-file cross-win64-mingw.ini build-dir-for-win64-mingw
#
# NOTE: You may name the build directory whatever you want. A popular
# convention is to use 'build' or begin with 'build'. Recommended. Keeps all
# the build directories grouped together in file listing, and makes it easy to
# blow away all the builds with `rm -r build*/` or, safer, with interactive
# prompt: `rm -rI build*/` or `find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'build*' -type d
# -print0 | xargs -0rp -n 1 rm -r`.
#
# Compile:
#
#   meson compile -v -C build-dir-for-win64-mingw
#
# Run on Fedora Linux using wine:
#
#   WINEPATH='/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin' wine64 build-dir-for-win64-mingw/shapes_bouncing_ball.exe
#
# Run on Windows:
#
#   build-dir-for-win64-mingw/shapes_bouncing_ball.exe

# [properties]
# A deprecation warning is printed: c_link_args in the [properties] section of the machine file is deprecated, use the [built-in options] section.
# Resolved the deprecation warning by moving c_link_args to new section [built-in options] below.

[built-in options]
# -lssp Fixes: undefined reference to `__strcpy_chk'
# -lwinmm Fixes: undefined reference to `timeEndPeriod' and 'timeBeginPeriod'
# NOT SURE IF NEEDED: '-lSDL2main', '-lSDL2'
#    Would requires SDL2
#    On Fedora for MINGW:
#       sudo dnf install mingw64-SDL2, or
#       sudo dnf install mingw64-SDL2-static, or
#    On Windows: Maybe download from here https://www.libsdl.org/
#    (I'm not sure about linking windows DLL's statically)
#    UPDATE: SDL2 IS NOT NEEDED AFTERALL?!! Not sure why I thought it was. I was just trying everything.
#    For the record, at one point I had this:
#    c_link_args = ['-lssp', '-lSDL2main', '-lSDL2', '-lm', '-luser32',
#       '-lgdi32', '-lwinmm', '-limm32', '-lole32', '-loleaut32', '-lversion',
#       '-luuid', '-ladvapi32', '-lsetupapi', '-lshell32', '-ldinput8', '-lmingw32',
#       '-Wl,--no-undefined', '-lmwindows']
#    I pieced that together from looking at:
#      /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/cmake/SDL2/SDL2staticTargets.cmake
#    and reading:
#      https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/6857
#    NOTE: Had to remove -luser32 because it causes error: "multiple definition of CloseWindow"
